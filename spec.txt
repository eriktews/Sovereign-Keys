Sovereign Key Draft Specification
Jered Wierzbicki

0. Overview.

Sovereign Keys (SKs) are public keys persistently bound to domain
names in a distributed log. This log is read mirrored so TLS clients
can validate keys when establishing connections. For more background
about the SK system see the design doc [1].

1.1. The distributed log.

The SK distributed log records the history of name to SK bindings.
To ease implementation and deployment, server nodes (see section 2)
keep their local log segments consistent, but the log is only weakly
globally ordered by synchronized clock measurements. This is simpler
than a strong global ordering like Paxos [2]. Log entries from
different segments are combined at lookup time (see section 1.4).

1.2. Log entries.

1.2.1. Canonical form.

Canonical form MUST be used to sign and check entry signatures and
transport entries in bulk (suitably compressed). Canonical form is a
7-bit ASCII plaintext representation. Its point is to be human
readable, obvious, signable, extensible, and permanent; extensions to
it SHOULD prefer string constants to magic numbers.

<type> ": " <version> '\n'
<field1> ": " <value> '\n'
...
<fieldN> ": " <value> '\n'
'\n'

<type> is a string constant giving an entry's type. <version> is a
decimal integer specifying the version of the entry type, and MUST be
incremented whenever fields are added, removed, or change meaning.
All previous versions of all entry types MUST be supported. <type> and
<version> together imply a set of fields which MUST follow.

<field>: <value> pairs MUST be sorted by field name in byte order.
Each <field> is a literal string constant. Each field expects a value
type. Binary values such as signatures and DERs MUST be URL safe
base64-encoded strings; integer values MUST be decimals with no
leading zeros; boolean values MUST be '1' (true) or '0' (false); and
timestamps MUST be a POSIX timestamp. Fields and values MUST NOT
contain ": " or '\n'; for simplicity, no provision is made for
escaping these sequences. If really needed, base64 encode the field.

Canonical form entries with invalid character encodings, missing or
unrecognized fields, or invalid values MUST NOT be processed.

1.2.2. Signing entries and checking signatures.

To sign an entry, SK services MUST convert it to canonical form with
all ignored fields, including the intended signature field, present
and set to the literal string "N/A", then replace the value for the
intended signature field.

Similarly, when checking an entry signature, SK services MUST first
convert the entry to canonical form and replace ignored fields,
including the checked signature field, with "N/A".

1.2.3. Common fields.

Timelines MUST stamp all log entries with an incrementing local
timeline serial number (SN) and a monotonically non-decreasing UTC
timestamp,

<Stamp fields> :=
  SN: <integer, incrementing local serial number>
  Timestamp: <monotonically non-decreasing timestamp>

The identity of a timeline is implied by its Signature which is only
valid for its key. "Signature" by itself as a field name always refers
to a timeline signature. "SK-Signature" means a signature by the
sovereign key holder over the values which they control in an entry.

1.2.4. Entry types.

Timelines MUST support the following log entry types.

1.2.4.1. Bind.

Bind entries establish an SK for a domain name. Some of the Bind
fields are repeated in other entries.

<Bind fields> :=
  Name: <string, domain name>
  Includes-Subdomains: <boolean, 1 or 0>
  Key: <binary DER, base64 encoded; size implies length>
  Key-Type: <string, RSA or ECC>
  Services: <string, comma separated services (see 1.3.1)>
  Rebinder-Names: <string, comma separated list of authorized
                   Rebinders (see 1.3.2)>
  CA-Cert-Chain: <DER, base64 encoded>
  SK-Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

So a bind entry looks like

  Bind: 1
  <Stamp fields>
  <Bind fields>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

SK-Signature MUST BE computed by the registrant over <Bind fields>.

1.2.4.2. Unbind.

Unbind entries invalidate an SK.

  Unbind: 1
  <Stamp fields>
  Name: <string, domain name>
  Last-Secure-Timestamp: <timestamp when SK was last secure, or
                          0 if don't know>
  SK-Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

SK-Signature MUST be a signature with Name's SK over Name and
Last-Secure-Timestamp.

1.2.4.3. Rebind.

Rebind entries re-establish the binding between an SK and a domain
name after an old SK has been unbound from that name.

  Rebind: 1
  <Stamp fields>
  <Bind fields>
  Rebinder-Name: <string, domain name>
  Rebinder-Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

Rebinder-Signature MUST be a signature with Rebinder-Name's SK over
<Bind fields> and Rebinder-Name.

1.2.4.4. Change-Services.

Change-Services entries store an update to the "Services" field for an
SK record.

  Change-Services: 1
  <Stamp fields>
  Name: <string, domain name>
  Services: <string, comma separated services (see 1.3.1)>
  SK-Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

SK-Signature MUST be a signature with Name's SK over Name and
Services.

1.2.4.5. Add-Root-CA.

Add-Root-CA entries record that a timeline trusts a new root CA as of
some time.

  <Stamp fields>
  CA-Cert: <binary, DER X.509 certificate, base64 encoded>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

1.2.4.6. Remove-Root-CA.

Remove-Root-CA entries record that a timeline no longer trusts a root
CA as of some time.

  <Stamp fields>
  CA-Cert-Hash: <SHA256 hash of untrusted cert, base64 encoded>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded>

1.3. Special field encodings.

1.3.1. Services field.

The Services field contains a comma-delimited list of service names
provided by the domain which MUST use its SK, e.g.

Services: https,smtps,imaps

The special value "all" means the SK should be used for all services.

Each service name MAY be suffixed with a colon and a non-default port
number, e.g. https:8080. Each service name MAY also contain a
semicolon delimited list of alternate routes for the service. The
syntax of alternate routes is undefined, except that they MUST NOT
contain a semicolon.

1.3.2. Rebinder-Names field.

The Rebinder-Names field contains a comma-separated list of domain
names which MAY rebind a new SK to a domain name which has revoked its
old SK binding. The string "none" means no domains are so authorized.

1.4. Combining entries from multiple log segments.

Clients combine log entries for a domain name from several log
segments at lookup time. Let X and Y be different log entries, and let
E.t be an entry timestamp, E.sn be an entry serial number, and E.tid
be the id of its timeline server. Then

  X "precedes" Y = X.t < Y.t || (X.t == Y.t &&
      (X.tid < Y.tid || (X.tid == Y.tid && X.sn < Y.sn))).

In a set of log entries, the "oldest" is the minimum under "precedes"
and the "newest" is the maximum under "precedes".

The following algorithm MUST be used to combine log entries to produce
a domain name's current SK record R:

a) Sort the entries from oldest to newest.
b) If there is an Unbind entry:
  1. Find the newest Unbind and check its signatures.
  2. If signatures check, discard the Unbind and all entries that
     precede it, else see section 5.
  3. Let R be the oldest Rebind among the remaining entries.
c) If there is no Unbind, let R be the oldest Bind.
d) If R is defined, find the newest Change Services entry after R;
   if any exists, check its signatures and update R's Services.

1.5. Wire protocol encoding.

SK mirrors and clients use a binary encoding to communicate. Messages
begin with this header:

#Bytes Field   Notes
1      Type    Specifies the message type.
1      Version Specifies the version of this message type.

After this is a list of values for the message. In vesion 0 message
types, values are not tagged; they are just concatenated in a defined
order. Extensions to this encoding SHOULD fill deleted fields with 0
and append new fields to the end of each message type. Non-compatible
changes to fields or encodings MUST introduce a new version number.

1.5.1. Value encodings.

Timestamps are encoded as unsigned 32-bit integers in little-endian
byte order. This will work until 7 February 2106. Future encoding
versions may revisit this choice.

Value encodings make use of varints, a variable length little-endian
integer encoding. The lower order 7 bits in each byte of a varint
encode 7 bits of a value. The high order bit of each byte is 0 if no
more bytes follow, and 1 if more higher order bytes follow. 

Integer values are encoded as varints. Binary values are encoded as a
varint length followed by length raw bytes.

Boolean values are the byte 1 for true or 0 for false.

Strings are NUL terminated.

1.5.2. Message types.

1.5.2.1. Timeline Freshness Messages (TFMs).

Signature               binary

1.5.7. NXDOMAIN messages.

NXDOMAIN messages have type 5 and, unlike other message types, MUST
contain a Name field so that the mirror signs a statement about which
domain it is that does not exist.

Field                   Encoding
Name                    string

2. Timeline servers.

Timeline servers or "timelines" implement a distributed read- and
append-only log. Timelines write log entries to a local segment and
publish it for efficient mirroring.

Each timeline must have a distinct public key. Timelines have an
address,

  TADDR = (domain name, port, public key)

and are identified by a globally unique integer timeline id (TID).
TIDs are assigned to TADDRs statically in the SK client library. Once
assigned, a TID is permanent. A TID MUST NOT be re-used for a timeline
with a different TADDR and MUST NOT have its assignment removed.

Timelines provide an HTTP interface.

2.1. /append requests.

Timelines MUST accept /append requests via HTTP POST. This is how
registrants write to a timeline's log segment, and also how timeline
operators log configuration like trusted CAs.

POST data should be e=<ENTRY> where <ENTRY> is the text of a log entry
in canonical form, encoded application/x-www-form-urlencoded. A POST
with missing or unrecognized form fields MUST be considered malformed.
Any timeline-controlled fields submitted as part of the POSTed "e",
such as timestamp and sequence number fields, MUST be ignored by the
timeline server; timelines MUST NOT ascribe special meanings to entry
fields in this context. Instead, this spec should be extended to
include additional POST form parameters if warranted.

Upon receiving an /append, timelines MUST respond as follows:

a) If overloaded or rate limiting, "503 Service Unavailable".
b) If POST data is malformed, "400 Bad Request".
c) Either
  1. Queue the request for later validation and respond with
     "202 Accepted" and a token to query via /status, or
  2. Perform validation steps immediately.
    a. If request times out, "408 Request Timeout".
    b. If request is invalid, "403 Forbidden".
    c. If a fault prevents completion, "500 Internal Server Error".
    d. If request is valid and complete, "201 Created".

Note timelines MUST NOT respond "201 Created" to /append unless the
entry is valid and committed to persistent storage, for example synced
to disk such that it will be available after a power failure. Clients
SHOULD assume that "201 Created" means an entry is part of the log and
will soon be published.

Because validating /append requests may involve communication with
other Internet servers, timelines SHOULD discard such requests active
for longer than some REQUEST_TIMEOUT and respond with "408 Request
Timeout".

2.1.1. Queueing for /append requests.

Because validation steps may be expensive, it is suggested that a
timeline SHOULD keep a queue of /append requests and limit the number
of simultaneous requests it handles. For example, pseudocode for
/append request queuing may look like

  if (num_queued == MAX_REQUESTS) {
    // Reject the request without any processing if too busy.
    respond(503);
  } else if (!check_entry(post_data)) {
    // Do not queue invalid requests.
    respond(400);
  } else {
    token = queue_request();
    if (num_queued > MAX_ACTIVE_REQUESTS) {
      // Defer request if it cannot be serviced immediately.
      respond(202, token);
    } else {
      // Handle the request immediately.
      handle_request();
    }
  }
  // Implied that queued requests become active as others finish.

2.1.2. Tokens for queued /append requests.

Timelines SHOULD provide a token to check the status of a queued
/append request in the body of a 202 response. Tokens MUST be suitable
for appending to a URI, and SHOULD be sufficiently random that they
cannot be trivially enumerated and will not collide soon after a
request. For example, tokens may be an URL-safe base64 encoded 36-bit
hash of the client IP, request time and a pseudorandom value.
Timelines which do not implement request status MUST respond with a
non-empty dummy value for token in the body of a 202 response.

2.1.3. Validation for /append requests.

Each entry implies preconditions that MUST be valid before it can be
appended. For example, entries which are not in valid canonical form
MUST be rejected. The following sections list other validation steps
for each entry type.

In addition, a timeline MUST keep its log segment consistent. All
entries require checking the current state of the timeline. This MAY
be the state as of the time when validation began, but a timeline MUST
NOT commit entries in an inconsistent order. For example if an Unbind
is committed for the Rebinder-Name in a Rebind while the Rebind is in
progress, the Rebind MUST NOT commit after it.

2.1.3.1. Validation for Bind entries.

a) Name and Rebinder-Names are lexically correct domain names.
b) There is no existing Bind entry for Name on this timeline.
c) SK-Signature is a valid signature with Key.
d) CA-Cert-Chain is from a trusted root cert.
e) CA-Cert-Chain signatures are correct.
f) OCSP response for end-entity cert is good.
g) Name matches the end-entity cert in CA-Cert-Chain.
h) Key matches the end-entity public key in CA-Cert-Chain.
i) Name is not among Rebinder-Names.
j) Key is distinct from the Keys for Rebinder-Names.

Other things which are potentially bad, but not fatal errors:

a) Rebinder-Names contains names which are not registered on this
   timeline.
b) Name or Rebinder-Names cannot be resolved.

2.1.3.2. Validation for Unbind entries.

a) Name is bound on this timeline.
b) SK-Signature is correct.

2.1.3.3. Validation for Rebind entries.

a) The newest entry for Name on this timeline is an Unbind.
b) Rebinder-Name is among the Rebinder-Names for the newest Bind
   for Name.
c) Rebinder-Name is bound on this timeline.
d) Rebinder-Signature is correct.
e) Validation steps for Bind entries.

2.1.3.4. Validation for Change-Services entries.

a) Name is currently bound on this timeline.
b) SK-Signature is correct.

2.1.3.5. Validation for Add-Root-CA entries.

a) Root CA is not already on this timeline.
b) Signature is a valid signature for this timeline's public key.

2.1.3.6. Validation for Remove-Root-CA entries.

a) Root CA is currently on this timeline.
b) Signature is a valid signature for this timeline's public key.

2.2. /status requests.

Timelines MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for /status with a
Timeline Freshness Message (TFM). A TFM response is formatted in the
entry canonical form

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-type: text/plain

  TFM: <version>
  Timestamp: <Current timestamp>
  Max-Published-SN: <Highest published serial number>
  Max-Published-Timestamp: <Timestamp for Max-SN>
  Max-SN: <Highest serial number of any entry>
  Max-Timestamp: <Highest timestamp of any entry>
  Signature: <binary, base64 encoded signature>

Timelines MUST recompute these responses whenever Timestamp has
changed between /status requests.

2.2.1. /status/<TOKEN> requests.

Timelines MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for /status/<TOKEN> where
<TOKEN> is a request token previously returned in a 202 response to
/append. They MUST respond "501 Not Implemented" if request status
tracking is not implemented.

Otherwise, timelines SHOULD keep request status for at least 5 minutes
after a request finishes, and MUST respond to /status/<TOKEN> as
follows:

a) If <TOKEN> is not being tracked, "410 Gone".
b) Otherwise, "200 OK" with a text/plain body where the first line is
   either "202 Accepted" if the request is still pending, or the
   status code which would have occurred had the request been
   processed immediately.

2.3. Publication.

Timelines MUST periodically publish "chunks" of their log segment to
publicly accessible URIs such as HTTP URLs or magnet URIs. These URIs
need not be served by the timeline. Chunks MUST be a concatenated,
in-order list of contiguous log entries in a range of serial numbers
and then a TFM, all in canonical form compressed with bzip2.

Chunks function as an incremental backup and mirroring mechanism. They
SHOULD be smaller and more frequent for recent history, and larger and
more infrequent for older history. For example, a timeline MAY provide
10 minute chunks for an hour, hourly chunks for the last several
hours, daily chunks for the last several days, then weekly and monthly
chunks, etc.

A timeline installation MAY archive but not publish some chunks for
internal use, for example in a tape backup system.

A timeline MUST provide all previously published entries from its log
segment as part of at least one publicly served chunk. Timeline
operators SHOULD ensure that all chunks remain at least minimally
available, for example by seeding them on bittorrent or periodically
testing HTTP mirrors.

2.3.1. /chunks requests.

Timelines MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for /chunks with a list of
publicly accessible URIs for chunks, a "chunk list", covering their
entire published log segment. The chunk list SHOULD be time ordered,
as short as possible, and SHOULD be precomputed and cached as chunks
are published or rotated rather than when serving /chunks.

The response to /chunks MUST be "200 OK" followed by a text/plain
\n-delimited chunk list:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/plain

  magnet:?xt=urn:sha1:... <sn1> <sn2> <base64 sig>
  https://chunks.example.com/a.bz2 <sn1> <sn2> <base64 sig>
  https://chunks.example.com/b.bz2 <sn1> <sn2> <base64 sig>

After each chunk URI, separated by a space, there MUST also follow the
first SN in that chunk, the last SN in that chunk, and then a
base64-encoded signature of the chunk with the timeline server's
public key. Mirrors will use this to ensure integrity.

2.3.2. /chunks/since/<SN> requests.

Timelines MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for /chunks/since/<SN>
with a list of chunks containing all log entries with serial
numbers higher than SN. If SN is not a valid serial number, a timeline
MUST respond "400 Bad Request". If no higher serial numbers have been
published, timelines MUST respond "304 Not Modified".  Otherwise the
response MUST be formatted as for a plain /chunks request. The chunk
list SHOULD be time ordered and include as few extra entries as
possible.

2.3.3. /chunks/between/<SN1>/and/<SN2> requests.

Timelines MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for

  /chunks/between/<SN1>/and/<SN2> 

with a list of chunks containing all log entries with serial numbers
higher than SN1 and lower than SN2. If SN1 or SN2 are not valid serial
numbers or SN1 >= SN2, a timeline MUST respond "400 Bad Request".
Otherwise the response MUST be formatted as for a plain /chunks
request. The chunk list SHOULD be time ordered and include as few
extra entries as possible.

3. Mirrors.

Mirrors replicate log segments from timelines, answer client queries,
and verify timeline integrity. A public mirror MUST replicate at least
two different timelines. Timeline operators MAY operate private
mirrors for testing, but MUST NOT publish these mirrors.

Mirrors MUST mirror from the beginning of each log segment for each
mirrored timeline; mirrors MUST NOT omit entries.

A mirror MUST track the TFM corresponding to the newest chunk it is
serving from each timeline it mirrors.

3.1. Updating a mirror.

A mirror MUST track state for each timeline it mirrors, which affects
how that timeline is updated and served. The state is one of New,
Idle, Syncing, Stuck, Defunct, or Corrupt. Mirrors MUST NOT respond to
name queries unless they have two or more Idle or Syncing timelines.

Mirror operators SHOULD monitor how much time each timeline spends in
each state. Timelines which spend much longer Syncing than Idle should
probably sync more frequently. Timelines which are often Stuck may
need special handling.

Chunk downloads SHOULD be prioritized in oldest first order per
timeline, splitting download bandwidth proportionally between mirrored
timelines. In normal operation there may be several chunks downloading
simultaneously per timeline. But note that oldest first gives Stuck
timelines priority, while not monopolizing bandwidth since they are
limited to one chunk download at a time (see section 3.1.4.)

3.1.1. New timelines.

Initially mirrored timelines have state New. A mirror MAY bootstrap
log segments for a timeline by offline means or by downloading URIs
listed in its /chunks response (see section 2.3.1). A timeline becomes
Idle after all of its chunks are initially downloaded, verified and
merged.

A mirror MUST NOT serve entries from a New timeline.

3.1.2. Idle timelines.

Every sync interval, 10 minutes or when reloading, e.g. on SIGHUP or
restart, a mirror SHOULD send /chunks/since/<Max-Published-SN> to each
of its Idle timelines where <Max-Published-SN> is the value from the
current TFM (see section 2.3.2).

If no new chunks have been published, a timeline remains Idle. If
there are new chunks, a timeline switches into Syncing state, tracking
its pending chunk list and desired sync range, the range of SNs in the
chunk list. If the /chunks/since/... request times out, the timeline
MUST be marked as Stuck with a sync range with a lower bound of the
current TFM Max-Published-SN and no upper bound.

3.1.3. Syncing timelines.

A Syncing timeline has a list of chunks it MUST download, verify, and
then merge from a /chunks request. When all chunks have been
downloaded, verified and merged, the timeline becomes Idle. If
something goes wrong, the timeline will instead become Stuck.

If a chunk download times out, i.e. its predicted completion time is
more than 2 minutes in the future for more than 2 minutes, the
download MUST be cancelled and the partial chunk deleted. The download
SHOULD be retried again after waiting 5 minutes, up to 3 times. After
a download fails 3 times, the timeline MUST be marked Stuck.

If a chunk's signature does not verify, it SHOULD be deleted, and the
timeline MUST be marked as Stuck.

Once a chunk is downloaded and verified, it MUST be merged with the
mirror database (see section 3.1.3.1.) As oldest remaining chunks
finish merging, the mirror's current TFM for a timeline MUST be
updated to the newest contiguous merged TFM, the lower bound of the
sync range MUST be updated, and the mirror MUST begin serving entries
from those chunk(s).

3.1.3.1. Merging entries.

Merging involves uncompressing, decoding, verifying, consistency
checking and writing entries. Merging SHOULD be done in a streaming
fashion so as not to monopolize system resources. If a data error such
as an invalid encoding or truncation is encountered during merging,
already merged entries from a chunk must not be committed, remaining
entries should be ignored, and the timeline MUST be marked as Stuck.

If an entry's timeline signature checks but its SK signature does not,
its timeline MUST be marked Corrupt with this entry as evidence. If
any of the consistency properties for an entry type with respect to
its own log segment are not satisfied (see section 2.1.3), the
timeline MUST be marked Corrupt, and this entry and any previous
conflicting entries are the evidence.

3.1.3.2. Note about transitioning to Stuck state.

On transitioning to the Stuck state, pending downloads MUST be
cancelled. Any entries newer than the mirror's current TFM which have
already been merged MAY be kept and ignored in the Stuck state, or MAY
be discarded; they will be redundantly downloaded and merged in the
Stuck state's recovery state machine.

3.1.4. Stuck timelines.

A timeline becomes Stuck when it cannot sync properly. This may be due
to invalid or missing chunks in its present sync range, or if it fails
to respond to a /chunks request. In this state the mirror first tries
to fetch a new chunk list from /chunks and then re-downloads and
verifies each chunk in the sync range serially before merging it.

A mirror SHOULD NOT serve entries from a Stuck timeline, but a mirror
MAY continue to serve cached responses including its entries for up to
24 hours. If a timeline remains in the Stuck state for more than 24
hours, a mirror MUST mark it as Defunct.

A mirror MUST keep a retry timer per Stuck timeline whose interval is
initially every 2 seconds and doubles upon any failure up to once an
hour.

After an interval of the retry timer, if the chunk list is empty, the
mirror MUST attempt to fetch a new chunk list for the last sync range.
If the sync range is not bounded above, this will be
/chunks/since/<SN>, otherwise /chunks/between/<SN1>/and/<SN2>.

If the timeline responds and the sync range was previously unbounded
above, a mirror MUST set up a new chunk list and sync range for the
timeline. If the sync range was previously bounded above and below,
the new chunk list is populated, but the sync range is not updated.

If the chunk list is non-empty, the mirror MUST download the oldest
remaining chunk and then verify and merge it. If download times out
(as in 3.1.3) or verification or merging fail, the chunk list should
be cleared and the retry timer reset, so that there will be a full
interval before the next retry. When a chunk is successfully merged,
the lower bound of the sync range MUST be updated to the next chunk
and the interval for the retry timer reset to its initial value.

When the sync range becomes empty, the current TFM is updated to the
just merged TFM, the sync range and chunk list are reset, and the
timeline is marked as Idle.

3.1.5. Defunct timelines.

Mirrors MUST NOT serve entries from Defunct timelines nor manage any
downloads for them. An operator MUST manually review what is going on
with Defunct timelines and either reinstate them as Stuck or stop
mirroring them.

3.1.6. Corrupt timelines.

When corruption is detected, a timeline MUST be marked as Corrupt. A
mirror MUST never serve entries from a Corrupt timeline after it
becomes Corrupt. It MAY stop mirroring all entries from the timeline,
but MUST keep evidence of corruption.

3.1.7. Special handling of Unbind entries.

While merging entries, mirrors SHOULD note any Unbind entries. As soon
as their TFMs are eligible for service, a mirror SHOULD invalidate any
responses cached for the affected names to minimize latency for
revokations.

3.1.8. Polling /status.

Separately from their update state machine, mirrors MUST poll /status
on each timeline every 10 minutes to collect updated TFMs. If a
timeline does not respond to /status on three attempts in a row, it
MUST be marked Defunct.

If the /status TFM is invalid or inconsistent with the current TFM for
a timeline, the timeline MUST be marked Corrupt. If Max-Published-SN
is the same as for the current TFM from a timeline, the current TFM
MUST be updated to this new TFM. If the interval between
Max-Published-Timestamp and Max-Timestamp is longer than 24 hours, a
timeline has apparently stopped publishing entries and MUST be marked
as Defunct.

3.1.9. Refreshing cached responses.

A mirror MAY lazily recompute cached responses which reference a stale
TFM as it has available resources.

Cache entries SHOULD expire about 30 minutes from when computed.

3.2. Name lookup queries.

Mirrors serve name lookup queries to retrieve all the entries related
to a name on their mirrored timelines. It's important that these
queries be served with low latency, but also that mirrors be reachable
through proxies and firewalls and reliable. Mirrors also need to
synchronize with clients to propagate evidence of corrupt timelines.

Mirrors MUST provide an HTTP interface, and MAY provide an UDP
interface for name lookups.

Mirrors SHOULD cache responses for common domains. Mirrors MUST check
that cached responses do not reference Defunct or Corrupt timelines
before serving them and recompute them if they do. Cache entries
referencing Corrupt timelines SHOULD be evicted, while Defunct entries
MAY be stored but MUST not be served.

3.2.1. Query response encoding.

Query responses MUST contain the following in this order encoded using
the wire protocol (see section 1.5).

a) The mirror timestamp when this response was computed.
b) The corrupt timeline list in effect for this response (see
   section 5.1).
c) TFMs for all relevant valid timelines as of the timestamp.
d) All entries for <domain name> ordered by "precedes" as of the
   timestamp for this response (see section 1.4).
e) A binary signature of the canonical form for this response by
   the mirror's public key.

If there are no entries for Name on any valid timeline, d) should be
replaced by an NXDOMAIN message for Name.

3.2.2. UDP query interface.

Mirrors MAY provide a UDP interface on port 8375. Responses longer
than MAX_UDP_SIZE defined below  MUST be sent over HTTP.
Realistically, responses spanning more than MAX_UDP_INET_DATAGRAMS
(TODO: suggest a value) which will travel over the general Internet
and not e.g. over a reliable LAN, SHOULD be sent over HTTP anyway.

3.2.2.1. Query requests.

Queries are a single UDP datagram with the following fields.

#Bytes Field   Notes
1      Type    Must be 0.
32     Hash    SHA-256 of previous response for this domain name, or
               zeros to force a new lookup.
1-255  Name    Domain name to query.
1      -       NUL terminator.

Mirrors SHOULD check to see if they have cached a response matching
Hash for the given Name. If they have, and it is still valid, they
SHOULD respond with one datagram containing that Hash (see below) to
signal it may be re-used. Note that these "up-to-date" responses might
be replayed by an attacker, but since clients MUST periodically
invalidate their caches, they will eventually see updates.

3.2.2.2. Query responses.

A mirror MUST NOT respond over UDP if it is not eligible to serve.

Responses might span several UDP datagrams. All datagrams start with
this header.

#Bytes Field   Notes
1      Version Encoding for this response. MUST be 0.
1      #Parts  Number of parts in this response minus one.
1      Part    Which part is this (0 to #Parts).
32     Hash    SHA-256 of the current response blob. If this is equal
               to the Hash from the query, #Parts MUST be 0.

Following the header is part of a binary blob of bytes which encodes
the response. The SHA-256 hash of the reassembled blob MUST match
Hash. If Hash does not match, clients should fall back to HTTP.

Each part of the blob may be up to 465 bytes = 576 (min guaranteed
IPv4 datagram size) - 60 (max IPv4 header) - 16 (UDP header) - 35
(datagram header). This implies a maximum response payload length
MAX_UDP_SIZE = 256 * 465 = 119040 bytes. Mirrors MUST NOT respond via
UDP when the response exceeds this size. Mirrors SHOULD NOT respond
via UDP to Internet clients when the response exceeds
MAX_UDP_INET_DATAGRAMS, but MAY choose to respond over UDP if e.g.
they know the client is on a fast local link with low packet loss.

Mirrors and clients SHOULD consider using zero-copy socket I/O [3].

3.2.3. HTTP interface.

Mirrors MUST provide an HTTP interface, ideally on port 80. The
interface SHOULD be provided by a fast, lightweight HTTP server which
MAY relax TCP slow start. Connections SHOULD NOT be persisted. Because
it's expected that navigation to novel domain names are infrequent for
a given client, it's probably better to make system resources
available for more clients than to tie them down for idle connections.

3.2.3.1. /q requests.

Mirrors MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for

  /q/<domain name>/h/<base64 hash>

If a mirror is not eligible to serve, it MUST respond with "503
Service Unavailable".

If the given base64 SHA-256 hash is still a valid hash of the cached
response for the domain name, then the mirror MUST respond "304 Not
Modified". Otherwise it SHOULD respond "200 OK" and send back a
response with Content-Type: application/octet-stream.

The first 32 bytes of data MUST be a SHA-256 hash, and what follows
MUST be a signed query response with that hash.

3.2.3.2. /gc requests.

Mirrors MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for /gc with a timestamp, a
list of timelines they currently know to be corrupt (sec 5.1),
evidence of corruption for each of these timelines (sec 5.2), signed
by the mirror's public key. The response code MUST be "200 OK", and
the response MUST have Content-Type: application/octet-stream.

The response is encoded in wire protocol encoding. The response SHOULD
be cached and recomputed every few minutes or when the list of corrupt
timelines changes.

3.2.3.3. /gc/<TID> GET requests.

Mirrors MUST respond to HTTP GET requests for /gc/<TID> with evidence
that TID is corrupt if they have any.

If TID is unknown to the mirror, the mirror MUST respond "404 Not
Found". If TID is not known to be corrupt, the mirror MUST respond
"204 No Content". Otherwise the mirror MUST respond "200 OK" with
wire protocol encoded evidence of corruption (see section 5.2) signed
by the mirror's public key.

3.2.3.4. /pc/<TID> POST requests.

Mirrors MUST accept HTTP POST requests to /pc/<TID> where TID is a
decimal integer TID. These requests are used to report evidence of
new corruption.

If a mirror is rate limiting /pc requests from a client, it MUST
return "503 Service Unavailable" without further processing.

If TID is unknown to the mirror, the mirror MUST ignore the request
and respond "404 Not Found". This may signal that the mirror needs to
update its client library. If TID is already known to be corrupt, the
mirror MUST respond "204 No Content".

POST data should be e=<EVIDENCE> where <EVIDENCE> is evidence of
corruption by timeline TID (see section 5.2), encoded in text and
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Mirrors MUST return "400 Bad Request" if evidence does not parse,
otherwise 202 Accepted if the evidence is properly encoded. Clients
may see /gc/<TID> for eventual status.

A mirror MUST check evidence with high priority if it knows about TID
and does not currently think it is corrupt, but to avoid DoS attacks,
SHOULD continue serving the timeline until evidence is checked. If TID
is really corrupt, the mirror must mark it Corrupt, add TID to its
corrupt timelines list, and invalidate all cached responses from TID.
It SHOULD proactively refresh cached responses which do not mention
TID with an updated corruption list.

If evidence does not check and TID is not corrupt, the client may be
malicious or an attacker or fault may have interfered with the
transmission of evidence. Mirrors SHOULD 503 /pc requests from clients
which submit more than 10 invalid requests per day.

3.2.4. HTTPS interface.

Mirrors MAY provide an HTTPS interface with the same semantics as the
HTTP interface to protect confidentiality and provide more resistance
to certain attacks. The HTTPS interface SHOULD be on port 443 if
possible. Note that clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use SK mirrors to
check the SK for a mirror, so this implies they SHOULD import and pin
certificates from mirrors directly in some bootstrapping step.

4. Clients.

Clients link the SK client library, which contains an authoritve list
of timelines and their public keys. They SHOULD be configured to query
one of several nearby SK mirrors by default.

4.1. Querying mirrors.

When initiating a TLS session, clients SHOULD in parallel query the
remote domain name on one or more SK mirrors and resolve the resulting
entries as described below. If the result is that the SK is invalid,
clients MUST indicate this to the user and MUST break the session.
Clients MAY attempt to use an alernative route specified in the remote
domain's Services entry, but MUST prompt the user for explicit consent
before doing so---in particular the compromised key MAY have been used
to update Services with a route to a rogue host.

Clients SHOULD cache mirror responses for a name, but to detect
revokations promptly, cached responses SHOULD be short-lived, at most
24 hours.

To assist in detecting corruption, clients SHOULD separately persist
as many timeline entries as they can to local disk. Clients SHOULD
also persist compressed mirror responses, especially the first
response from a mirror for a name and responses that include new
timeline entries.

Mirror responses MAY be encoded by saving their signature, their
non-timeline entry fields and a list of indices into a local database
of distinct timeline entries.

4.1.1. Resolving mirror responses.

Clients SHOULD use the following algorithm to probe several mirrors to
find a fresh enough response. In the typical case, a single mirror
SHOULD be fresh enough.

TODO: Reformat this pseudocode.

T1 = 24 hours    # No querying necessary if records are fresher than this
T2 = 48 hours    # 24-48 hours: acceptable, but query proactively
T3 = 1 week      # Records older than an week are bad news, though we will
                 # somewhat tolerate a small number of dysfunctional timelines 
                 # in this state
T4 = 2 weeks     # Once a few timelines reach this age, we fail open

MAX_DERELICT_TIMELINES=2    # Timelines are derelict if nobody is seeing updates
                            # from them.  We will tolerate this number of them

N_RETRIES=5      # Number of mirrors to try if we aren't getting fresh enough
                 # responses

number_fresh=0
for s in timeline_servers:
    if s.entries_for_name(name).freshness > getcurrenttime() - T1:
      number_fresh +=1
if number_fresh == len(timeline_servers):
    return SUCCESS

for n in range(N_RETRIES):
  
   # START_QUERY_ATTEMPT
   if len(GOOD_MIRRORS) == 0:
     return FAILURE
   m = random.choice(GOOD_MIRRORS) # clients MAY prefer mirrors which are 
                                   # provided by their ISP or network, or 
                                   # may select from a global list
   response = m.query(name)
   number_fresh_enough = 0
   number_stale = number_very_stale = 0
   for s in timeline_servers:
       s.entries_for_name(name).update_from_response(response)
       freshness = s.entries_for_name(name).freshness
       if freshness < m.best_freshness_observed_for_timeline(s):
           # This mirror just gave us a /less/ fresh response for this name 
           # than it had done for some other name. Never use it again.
           GOOD_MIRRORS -= m
           goto # START_QUERY_ATTEMPT

       lag = getcurrenttime() - freshness
       if lag < T2:
           number_fresh_enough += 1
       else:
           if lag > T3:
             number_stale += 1
           if lag > T4:
             number_very_stale +=1
       
       if (number_fresh_enough >= len(timeline_servers) * 0.8) AND 
          (number_stale <= MAX_DERELICT_TIMELINES):
           return SUCCESS

if number_very_stale > MAX_DERELICT_TIMELINES:
    # If 3 or more non-corrupt timeline servers have not been updated for 2
    # weeks, we are under successful attack.  Fail open.  
    return FAILURE
else:
    return SUCCESS

Clients MUST check that mirror replies are consistent with persisted
entries from previous queries. If a mirror provides a response whose
contents omitted entries for the queried name X that predate the
relevant freshness messages and are cached by the client, the client
MUST mark this mirror as corrupt. The client SHOULD store evidence and
MAY report this corruption to the SK maintainers.

If a response includes an entry with the same serial number but
different content to a previously seen entry, and its timeline
signature checks, the client MUST save this evidence, mark the
timeline corrupt, and post evidence of this corruption to the origin
mirror.

A mirror MUST also be considered corrupt if a timeline is removed from
its corrupt timelines list as of a newer timestamp, or if it returns a
response from a timeline which it also thinks is corrupt.

Even if it has no persisted entries, a client MUST ignore a response
which shows an inconsistent sequence of events at a single timeline
according to the consistency rules in section 2.1.3. It is not
possible to determine in general in this case whether the mirror or
timeline is corrupt. Clients MUST also ignore malformed responses, and
MAY stop querying a mirror that regularly provides them.

When a client has found one or more fresh enough mirror responses, it
may reconstruct the history of entries for the domain name as
described in section 1.4 and resolve the current status of the entry
for the domain.

4.1.2. Synchronizing corrupt timelines with mirrors.

If a mirror response includes a corrupt timeline list that does not
match the client's list, the client MUST attempt to send evidence the
mirror is missing and hear evidence it is missing from the mirror.
This SHOULD be a non-blocking background task.

If a mirror states that an unknown TID is corrupt, the client MUST
ignore that, as it MUST ignore entries from unknown TIDs. Possibly the
mirror is corrupt, or the client's library is old. If a mirror
presents invalid evidence of corruption, it MUST be ignored if the
mirror's signature does not check; if the mirror's signature does
check, the mirror MUST be marked corrupt.

If a mirror response is missing any corrupt TID(s) known to the
client, the client MUST POST /pc/<TID> with evidence for each such
TID. If the mirror replies "204 No Content" or "202 Accepted", a
client MUST NOT send /pc/<TID> for this TID again. If the mirror
responds "404", the client should send it evidence again after its
next query response from the mirror, if the mirror still has not
registered TID as corrupt.

5. Corruption.

Mirrors check the integrity of timelines, and clients check the
integrity of timelines and mirrors in the SK system. Mirrors and
clients MUST detect and report corruption.

5.1. Tracking corrupt timelines.

The SK system maintains a corrupt timeline list. This list is
serialized in plaintext encoding as a comma-separated list of corrupt
TIDs (integers) sorted in increasing order by TID. In binary encoding,
it is as a varint length followed by length varint TIDs, again sorted
increasing by TID.

5.2. Evidence of corruption.

It is also important that SK clients and mirrors keep evidence of
corruption, which is a minimal set of inconsistent signed entries. In
binary encoding, evidence is a concatenated list of messages showing
corruption, while in plaintext encoding it is the concatenated
canonical forms of the same entries.

6. Operational procedures.

The SK system requires a central list of timeline servers to be
maintained. In addition, a list of known mirrors and their public keys
is kept for convenience. This is done by the "SK maintainers", who are
commiters entrusted with the client library code.

6.1. Timekeeping.

Timelines, mirrors and clients SHOULD all use NTP to keep their clocks
reasonably synchronized with UTC. Note implementations may repeat or
roll back a timestamp during a leap second [4], or may roll it back a
lot in case of exceptional events. Timelines and mirrors MUST take
care to ensure that all timestamps they generate are monotonically
non-decreasing.

6.2. Establishing a new timeline.

The SK maintainers MUST approve a change to the SK client library to
add a new TID to TADDR mapping for each new timeline. A timeline
SHOULD NOT begin operating until its TID assignment is committed to
the SK client library. SK clients and mirrors MUST ignore entries from
unknown timelines.

6.3. Discontinuing a timeline.

If a timeline becomes corrupt, affected clients and mirrors MUST
immediately stop trusting it. Clients MAY, and mirrors MUST report
evidence of corruption to the SK maintainers within 24 hours. The SK
maintainers MUST publish and verify evidence, flag the corrupt TID in
the SK client library, and push an update.

If a timeline wishes to discontinue operation, its operators SHOULD
notify its known mirrors first.

6.4. Establishing a new mirror.

Mirrors MAY notify the SK maintainers of their (domain name, port,
public key), for possible publication in the "known mirrors" list.

6.5. Discontinuing a mirror.

Clients MUST permanently stop trusting a mirror that becomes corrupt,
and SHOULD notify the SK maintainers. The SK maintainers MAY accept
evidence of mirror corruption from clients (TODO: how?), verify and
publish it (TODO: how?), and remove any mention of corrupt mirrors
from the "known mirrors" list.

6.6. Updating the client library.

TODO: How?

6.7. Registering a name.

Registrants SHOULD register their name to SK binding on many timelines
in different regions in case a timeline fails. As the SK system grows,
they SHOULD also ensure their key is registered on some new timelines.

Note that a name holder SHOULD check that their name is returned by
one or more mirrors before considering it successfully registered on a
timeline. Registrants SHOULD keep a copy of a timeline-signed entries
they expect from each timeline, and also of the signed mirror
responses including these entries, much as normal SK clients SHOULD.
This way a name holder MAY check integrity of their names and detect
corruption before clients are affected.
